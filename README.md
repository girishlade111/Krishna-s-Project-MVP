## ℹ️ About This Project

This project is a front-end exercise. The primary goal was to take a static image of a live website and reproduce its design and layout using core web technologies. It demonstrates skills in:

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure and organization of content.
* **CSS3:** Advanced layout (Grid & Flexbox), custom properties (variables), and precise styling for a "pixel-perfect" result.
* **JavaScript:** Minimal, non-obtrusive JS for potential micro-interactions (like the video play button).

This is **not** a functional website; it has no backend, and all content is hardcoded. It serves as a portfolio piece showcasing attention to detail and front-end capabilities.
